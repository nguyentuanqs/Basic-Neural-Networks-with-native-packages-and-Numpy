#Basic-Neural-Networks-with-native-packages-and-Numpy
In this respitory, I am going to collect projects about deep learning and Neural Networks which is coding in basic packages like Numpy and native Python packages as much as possible. 
In addition, I will try to explain and give my oppinion to the projects and coding programs that I suppose that it would be helpful to beginer.
