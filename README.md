#Basic-Neural-Networks-with-native-packages-and-Numpy
In this respitory, I am going to collect projects about deep learning and Neural Networks which is coding in basic packages like Numpy and native Python packages as much as possible. 
In addition, I will try to explain and give my oppinion to the projects and coding programs that I suppose that it would be helpful to beginer. 
bassically, the model should be like this: 
https://github.com/nguyentuanqs/Basic-Neural-Networks-with-native-packages-and-Numpy/blob/master/Visualize%20a%20model.png
The model in the first project has 2 layers which are a hidden layer followed with an ouput layer. 
The input of the hidden layer is the input layer. Technically, this could be considered as a dependent layer but in fact, there is no parameters in it, so it shouldnt be a layer :D 
In the ouput layer, softmax function is applied to give probabilities of predictions.
